For instance, a software provider that specialized in payroll for 1099 contractor-heavy businesses used Synapse to provide an instant payment feature; others used it to offer specialized credit/debit cards.\\xa0\\n\\nThe San Francisco-based startup raised a total of just over $50 million in venture capital in its lifetime, including a 2019 [$33 million Series B raise](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/synapse-raises-33m/)\\n led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Angela Strange. Synapse [wobbled in 2023 with layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/a16z-backed-fintech-synapse-lays-off-40-of-its-staff/)\\n and [filed for Chapter 11](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/softbank-backed-tabapay-is-buying-the-assets-of-a16z-backed-synapse-after-it-filed-for-bankruptcy/)\\n in April of this year, hoping to sell its assets in a $9.7 million fire sale to another fintech, TabaPay. But [TabaPay walked](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/tabapay-ends-plans-synapse-mercury-evolve/)\\n.\\xa0\\n\\nThe result was that Synapse was forced to liquidate entirely under Chapter 7 and a lot of other fintechs such as Juno, Yotta and Yieldstreet — and their customers — are paying the price for Synapse’s demise.\\xa0\\n\\nThe debacle has left observers [questioning the banking-as-a-service concept and digital banking as a whole](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/synapse-bankruptcy-fintech-fdic-insurance.html)\\n, considering that millions of consumers with nearly $160 million in deposits remain unable to access their funds.\\xa0\\n\\nHere is a timeline of Synapse’s troubles and the ongoing impact it is having on banking consumers.\\xa0\\n\\n2024\\n----\\n\\n### Nearly $160 million in funds still frozen\\n\\n**July 7:** Fintech Business Weekly reports that a recent “[status conference](https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/synapse-bankruptcy-little-progress)\\n in the ongoing Synapse bankruptcy didn’t offer much hope to end users whose funds were still frozen, with efforts to reconcile and release the remaining funds, approximately $158.6 million, appearing to slow.” This means that about $158.6 million was still owed to end users.\\xa0However, there was an estimated $65 million to $95 million in funds that were missing.\\xa0\\n\\n### Senators urge Synapse and its partners and backers to restore customers’ access to their money\\n\\n**July 1:** A group of senators banded together to urge Synapse’s owners and bank and fintech partners to [“immediately restore customers’ access to their money.”](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/senators-urge-synapses-owners-partners-and-vc-funders-to-restore-customers-access-to-their-money/)\\n As part of their demands, the senators implicated both the partners and the venture investors of the company as being responsible for missing customer funds.\\n\\n### Synapse CEO moves on to starting another company\\n\\n**June 12:** Synapse’s CEO Sankaet Pathak has reportedly already [raised $10 million](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/synapse-ex-ceo-nabs-10-million-for-new-robotics-startup)\\n for a new robotics startup even while [questions remained](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/07/synapse-bankruptcy-trustee-85-million-of-customer-savings-is-missing.html)\\n on the whereabouts of $85 million in Synapse’s customer savings.\\n\\n### Fallout continues, more fintechs and millions of consumers affected\\xa0\\n\\n**May 25:** Based on Synapse’s filings, [as many as 100 fintechs and 10 million end customers](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/with-a16z-backed-synapses-collapse-baas-fintech-is-a-mess-and-10-million-consumers-could-be-hurt/)\\n were potentially impacted by the company’s collapse by the end of May. For instance, funds at crypto app Juno and banking platform Yotta were also impacted by Synapse’s collapse. Meanwhile, [Mainvest](https://mainvest.com/)\\n, a fintech lender to restaurant businesses, said it was actually shutting down as a result.\\n\\n### U.S. Trustee pushes for Chapter 7\\n\\n**May 16:** A United States trustee filed an emergency motion to convert Synapse’s debt reorganization Chapter 11 bankruptcy into a [liquidation Chapter 7](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/a-us-trustee-wants-troubled-fintech-synapse-to-be-liquidated-via-chapter-7-bankruptcy-cites-gross-mismanagement/)\\n. The trustee said that Synapse had “grossly” mismanaged its estate so that losses were continuing with little “reasonable likelihood of reorganization” that would allow the company to emerge on the other side and carry on.\\n\\n### Customer teen banking startup Copper discontinues its banking operations\\n\\n**May 13**: Synapse customer teen banking startup Copper had to [abruptly discontinue its banking deposit accounts and debit cards](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/teen-fintech-copper-had-to-emergency-discontinue-its-banking-debit-products/)\\n as a result of Synapse’s difficulties. That left an unknown number of consumers, mostly families, without access to the funds they had trustingly deposited into Copper’s accounts.\\xa0\\n\\n### Sale of assets called off\\n\\n**May 9**: TabaPay said it had [abandoned its plans](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/tabapay-ends-plans-synapse-mercury-evolve/)\\n to purchase Synapse’s assets. There was lots of finger-pointing when that deal dissolved. Synapse’s CEO made accusations\\xa0 that the problem was banking partner Evolve Bank & Trust. And Evolve denied those charges, saying it was not involved, and not to blame. Meanwhile, another player in the saga, Mercury, said Synapse’s allegations had “no merit.”\\n\\n### Synapse files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, assets to be sold off for $9.7 million\\n\\n**April 22:** Synapse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and said at that time that its assets would be [acquired by instant payments company TabaPay](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/softbank-backed-tabapay-is-buying-the-assets-of-a16z-backed-synapse-after-it-filed-for-bankruptcy/)\\n, pending bankruptcy court approval. (Again, TabaPay would walk away from the deal a couple weeks later.)\\n\\n2023\\n----\\n\\n### Synapse lays off staff, reports of tension with partner Evolve Bank arise\\n\\n**October 13:** Evolve Bank & Trust and startup digital bank Mercury ended their respective relationships with Synapse and work directly with each other. Evolve and Synapse addressed the brouhaha [here](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/synapse-evolve-mercury-fintech/)\\n.\\n\\n**October 6**: Synapse confirmed that it had [laid off](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/a16z-backed-fintech-synapse-lays-off-40-of-its-staff/)\\n 86 people, or about 40% of the company. That was just four months after the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as “the current macroeconomic conditions” had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth. In 2019, TechCrunch reported on the company’s [$33 million Series B raise](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/synapse-raises-33m/)\\n led by Andreessen Horowitz after rebranding from SynapseFi.\\xa0\\n\\n_Want more fintech news in your inbox?

For instance, a software provider that specialized in payroll for 1099 contractor-heavy businesses used Synapse to provide an instant payment feature; others used it to offer specialized credit/debit cards.\\xa0\\n\\nThe San Francisco-based startup raised a total of just over $50 million in venture capital in its lifetime, including a 2019 [$33 million Series B raise](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/synapse-raises-33m/)\\n led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Angela Strange. Synapse [wobbled in 2023 with layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/a16z-backed-fintech-synapse-lays-off-40-of-its-staff/)\\n and [filed for Chapter 11](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/softbank-backed-tabapay-is-buying-the-assets-of-a16z-backed-synapse-after-it-filed-for-bankruptcy/)\\n in April of this year, hoping to sell its assets in a $9.7 million fire sale to another fintech, TabaPay. But [TabaPay walked](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/tabapay-ends-plans-synapse-mercury-evolve/)\\n.\\xa0\\n\\nThe result was that Synapse was forced to liquidate entirely under Chapter 7 and a lot of other fintechs such as Juno, Yotta and Yieldstreet — and their customers — are paying the price for Synapse’s demise.\\xa0\\n\\nThe debacle has left observers [questioning the banking-as-a-service concept and digital banking as a whole](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/synapse-bankruptcy-fintech-fdic-insurance.html)\\n, considering that millions of consumers with nearly $160 million in deposits remain unable to access their funds.\\xa0\\n\\nHere is a timeline of Synapse’s troubles and the ongoing impact it is having on banking consumers.\\xa0\\n\\n2024\\n----\\n\\n### Nearly $160 million in funds still frozen\\n\\n**July 7:** Fintech Business Weekly reports that a recent “[status conference](https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/synapse-bankruptcy-little-progress)\\n in the ongoing Synapse bankruptcy didn’t offer much hope to end users whose funds were still frozen, with efforts to reconcile and release the remaining funds, approximately $158.6 million, appearing to slow.” This means that about $158.6 million was still owed to end users.\\xa0However, there was an estimated $65 million to $95 million in funds that were missing.\\xa0\\n\\n### Senators urge Synapse and its partners and backers to restore customers’ access to their money\\n\\n**July 1:** A group of senators banded together to urge Synapse’s owners and bank and fintech partners to [“immediately restore customers’ access to their money.”](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/senators-urge-synapses-owners-partners-and-vc-funders-to-restore-customers-access-to-their-money/)\\n As part of their demands, the senators implicated both the partners and the venture investors of the company as being responsible for missing customer funds.\\n\\n### Synapse CEO moves on to starting another company\\n\\n**June 12:** Synapse’s CEO Sankaet Pathak has reportedly already [raised $10 million](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/synapse-ex-ceo-nabs-10-million-for-new-robotics-startup)\\n for a new robotics startup even while [questions remained](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/07/synapse-bankruptcy-trustee-85-million-of-customer-savings-is-missing.html)\\n on the whereabouts of $85 million in Synapse’s customer savings.\\n\\n### Fallout continues, more fintechs and millions of consumers affected\\xa0\\n\\n**May 25:** Based on Synapse’s filings, [as many as 100 fintechs and 10 million end customers](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/with-a16z-backed-synapses-collapse-baas-fintech-is-a-mess-and-10-million-consumers-could-be-hurt/)\\n were potentially impacted by the company’s collapse by the end of May. For instance, funds at crypto app Juno and banking platform Yotta were also impacted by Synapse’s collapse. Meanwhile, [Mainvest](https://mainvest.com/)\\n, a fintech lender to restaurant businesses, said it was actually shutting down as a result.\\n\\n### U.S. Trustee pushes for Chapter 7\\n\\n**May 16:** A United States trustee filed an emergency motion to convert Synapse’s debt reorganization Chapter 11 bankruptcy into a [liquidation Chapter 7](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/a-us-trustee-wants-troubled-fintech-synapse-to-be-liquidated-via-chapter-7-bankruptcy-cites-gross-mismanagement/)\\n. The trustee said that Synapse had “grossly” mismanaged its estate so that losses were continuing with little “reasonable likelihood of reorganization” that would allow the company to emerge on the other side and carry on.\\n\\n### Customer teen banking startup Copper discontinues its banking operations\\n\\n**May 13**: Synapse customer teen banking startup Copper had to [abruptly discontinue its banking deposit accounts and debit cards](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/teen-fintech-copper-had-to-emergency-discontinue-its-banking-debit-products/)\\n as a result of Synapse’s difficulties. That left an unknown number of consumers, mostly families, without access to the funds they had trustingly deposited into Copper’s accounts.\\xa0\\n\\n### Sale of assets called off\\n\\n**May 9**: TabaPay said it had [abandoned its plans](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/tabapay-ends-plans-synapse-mercury-evolve/)\\n to purchase Synapse’s assets. There was lots of finger-pointing when that deal dissolved. Synapse’s CEO made accusations\\xa0 that the problem was banking partner Evolve Bank & Trust. And Evolve denied those charges, saying it was not involved, and not to blame. Meanwhile, another player in the saga, Mercury, said Synapse’s allegations had “no merit.”\\n\\n### Synapse files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, assets to be sold off for $9.7 million\\n\\n**April 22:** Synapse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and said at that time that its assets would be [acquired by instant payments company TabaPay](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/softbank-backed-tabapay-is-buying-the-assets-of-a16z-backed-synapse-after-it-filed-for-bankruptcy/)\\n, pending bankruptcy court approval. (Again, TabaPay would walk away from the deal a couple weeks later.)\\n\\n2023\\n----\\n\\n### Synapse lays off staff, reports of tension with partner Evolve Bank arise\\n\\n**October 13:** Evolve Bank & Trust and startup digital bank Mercury ended their respective relationships with Synapse and work directly with each other. Evolve and Synapse addressed the brouhaha [here](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/synapse-evolve-mercury-fintech/)\\n.\\n\\n**October 6**: Synapse confirmed that it had [laid off](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/a16z-backed-fintech-synapse-lays-off-40-of-its-staff/)\\n 86 people, or about 40% of the company. That was just four months after the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as “the current macroeconomic conditions” had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth. In 2019, TechCrunch reported on the company’s [$33 million Series B raise](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/synapse-raises-33m/)\\n led by Andreessen Horowitz after rebranding from SynapseFi.\\xa0\\n\\n_Want more fintech news in your inbox?

Yet it’s not easy to make a direct correlation between something like, say, Microsoft Copilot, and overall business performance.\\n\\nShould CIOs simply take it on faith then? In this week’s [Clouded Judgement newsletter](https://open.substack.com/pub/cloudedjudgement/p/clouded-judgement-71224-the-red-queen?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=56878&post_id=146443935&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=2232r&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNDU2NTMxLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDY0NDM5MzUsImlhdCI6MTcyMDc4OTg2MywiZXhwIjoxNzIzMzgxODYzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNTY4NzgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.-nS80h0YCf9Kxgck9_bbosK8t8bYAVKwGHIDikcjSvk)\\n, investor Jamin Ball suggests that most businesses might not have a choice. In his view, they might not see the results for some time, leaving them to make a very tough buying decision.\\n\\nHere’s Ball’s take:\\n\\n> “Right now the world is evolving — AI is a massive platform shift. And by NOT adopting / spending on it, you risk losing market share and slowly becoming irrelevant. Because your competitors are investing in AI efforts, you also have to invest in AI efforts. At the end of the day these investments might not immediately result in better business outcomes (i.e., more revenue), but they certainly lead to better end user experiences. And very well may lead to better “other” metrics like retention or churn. If your competitors are building better end user experiences and you’re not, then you may find yourself in trouble in the short / medium term,” Ball wrote.\\n\\nYet CIOs want more certainty than that before they go blindly into an expensive new technology, no matter how game changing it could be. They and the company CFO have to deal with the reality of the here and now when it comes to justifying expenses, and if they are spending big money, when can they reasonably expect to get a return on their investment?\\n\\nAt the same time, those who use the electricity analogy for AI, may believe that this is AI’s [electricity moment](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/ai-critical-light-bulb-moment/)\\n — that moment in the late 18th century when factories began switching over from steam to electricity. You could ignore it and continue along with steam, but at some point you were going to get steamrolled (pun intended).\\n\\nPerhaps the answer could lie with some savvy startup, or more likely enterprises of a certain size will turn to the usual suspects — Deloitte, McKinsey and Accenture — and pay them a hefty fee to help them figure it out. Ironically, that will just increase the cost and the time to value.\\n\\nAs the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia once sang in “[The Wheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=You+can%E2%80%99t+go+back+and+you+can%E2%80%99t+stand+still.+If+the+thunder+won%E2%80%99t+get+you%2C+then+the+lightning+will.&rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS1076US1076&oq=You+can%E2%80%99t+go+back+and+you+can%E2%80%99t+stand+still.+If+the+thunder+won%E2%80%99t+get+you%2C+then+the+lightning+will.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEHNTY4ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#wptab=si:ACC90nxRWvuwqTR4TiacZ7sCfkHhcGgWdDOv2v2HxpHAAuIhwd0hqVQcoOD2_2OWmYVP1phOF2IDMcxP6NqndqjPFpZj89PAUEhoK67O1MzS-6BvjVYBxlr_Hjckacv2TApAj07l2ZswFOeMn5IiMI4IqTKfr1vjoVGxGdypSd1wWfSxIb-Dm5A%3D)\\n,” “You can’t go back and you can’t stand still. If the thunder won’t get you, then the lightning will.” CIOs trying to figure out how to proceed are left to decide whether they are marching their companies steadily toward the future, or throwing good money after bad.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F07%2F14%2Fthe-ai-financial-results-paradox%2F&text=The+AI+financial+results+paradox&via=techcrunch)\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F07%2F14%2Fthe-ai-financial-results-paradox%2F)\\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F07%2F14%2Fthe-ai-financial-results-paradox%2F&title=The+AI+financial+results+paradox&summary=There+is+a+general+consensus+today+that+generative+AI+is+going+to+transform+business+in+a+profound+way%2C+and+companies+and+individuals+who+don%E2%80%99t+get+on+board+will+be+quickly+left+in+the+dustbin+of+history.+At+the+same+time%2C+as+companies+delve+more+deeply+into+this+technology%2C+they+want+proof%2C+actual+business+metrics%2C+that+%5B%E2%80%A6%5D&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)\\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F07%2F14%2Fthe-ai-financial-results-paradox%2F&title=The+AI+financial+results+paradox)\\n[](mailto:?subject=The+AI+financial+results+paradox&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F07%2F14%2Fthe-ai-financial-results-paradox%2F)\\n[](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/the-ai-financial-results-paradox/)\\n\\n### More TechCrunch\\n\\n### Get the industry’s biggest tech news\\n\\n[Explore all newsletters](https://techcrunch.com/newsletters/)\\n\\n##### TechCrunch Daily News\\n\\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.\\n\\nAdd TechCrunch Daily News to your subscription choices\\n\\n##### Startups Weekly\\n\\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\\n\\nAdd Startups Weekly to your subscription choices\\n\\n##### TechCrunch Fintech\\n\\nThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.\\n\\nAdd TechCrunch Fintech to your subscription choices\\n\\n##### TechCrunch Mobility\\n\\nTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.\\n\\nAdd TechCrunch Mobility to your subscription choices\\n\\nNo newsletters selected\\n\\nNo newsletters\\n\\nEmail address (required)\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our [Terms](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html)\\n and [Privacy Notice](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html)\\n.\\n\\n[Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/)\\n\\n[How to tell if your online accounts have been hacked](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/how-to-tell-if-your-online-accounts-have-been-hacked/)\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)\\n\\n2 hours ago\\n\\nThis is a guide on how to check whether someone compromised your online accounts.\\n\\n[![How to tell if your online accounts have been hacked](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-captain-instagram.jpg?w=1024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/how-to-tell-if-your-online-accounts-have-been-hacked/)\\n\\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/)\\n\\n[The AI financial results paradox](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/the-ai-financial-results-paradox/)\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Ron Miller](https://techcrunch.com/author/ronjourn/)\\n\\n3 hours ago\\n\\nThere is a general consensus today that generative AI is going to transform business in a profound way, and companies and individuals who don’t get on board will be quickly…\\n\\n[![The AI financial results paradox](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1201452137.jpg?w=1024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/the-ai-financial-results-paradox/)\\n\\n**Image Credits:** Berkah / Getty Images\\n\\n[Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/)\\n\\n[Google reportedly in talks to acquire cloud security company Wiz for $23B](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/14/google-reportedly-in-talks-to-acquire-cloud-security-company-wiz-for-23b/)\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Anthony Ha](https://techcrunch.com/author/anthony-ha/)\\n\\n4 hours ago\\n\\nGoogle’s parent company Alphabet might be on the verge of making its biggest acquisition ever.

Yet it’s not easy to make a direct correlation between something like, say, Microsoft Copilot, and overall business performance.\\n\\nShould CIOs simply take it on faith then? In this week’s [Clouded Judgement newsletter](https://open.substack.com/pub/cloudedjudgement/p/clouded-judgement-71224-the-red-queen?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=56878&post_id=146443935&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=2232r&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNDU2NTMxLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDY0NDM5MzUsImlhdCI6MTcyMDc4OTg2MywiZXhwIjoxNzIzMzgxODYzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNTY4NzgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.-nS80h0YCf9Kxgck9_bbosK8t8bYAVKwGHIDikcjSvk)\\n, investor Jamin Ball suggests that most businesses might not have a choice. In his view, they might not see the results for some time, leaving them to make a very tough buying decision.\\n\\nHere’s Ball’s take:\\n\\n> “Right now the world is evolving — AI is a massive platform shift. And by NOT adopting / spending on it, you risk losing market share and slowly becoming irrelevant. Because your competitors are investing in AI efforts, you also have to invest in AI efforts. At the end of the day these investments might not immediately result in better business outcomes (i.e., more revenue), but they certainly lead to better end user experiences. And very well may lead to better “other” metrics like retention or churn. If your competitors are building better end user experiences and you’re not, then you may find yourself in trouble in the short / medium term,” Ball wrote.\\n\\nYet CIOs want more certainty than that before they go blindly into an expensive new technology, no matter how game changing it could be. They and the company CFO have to deal with the reality of the here and now when it comes to justifying expenses, and if they are spending big money, when can they reasonably expect to get a return on their investment?\\n\\nAt the same time, those who use the electricity analogy for AI, may believe that this is AI’s [electricity moment](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/ai-critical-light-bulb-moment/)\\n — that moment in the late 18th century when factories began switching over from steam to electricity. You could ignore it and continue along with steam, but at some point you were going to get steamrolled (pun intended).\\n\\nPerhaps the answer could lie with some savvy startup, or more likely enterprises of a certain size will turn to the usual suspects — Deloitte, McKinsey and Accenture — and pay them a hefty fee to help them figure it out. Ironically, that will just increase the cost and the time to value.\\n\\nAs the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia once sang in “[The Wheel](https://www.google.com/search?q=You+can%E2%80%99t+go+back+and+you+can%E2%80%99t+stand+still.+If+the+thunder+won%E2%80%99t+get+you%2C+then+the+lightning+will.&rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS1076US1076&oq=You+can%E2%80%99t+go+back+and+you+can%E2%80%99t+stand+still.+If+the+thunder+won%E2%80%99t+get+you%2C+then+the+lightning+will.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEHNTY4ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#wptab=si:ACC90nxRWvuwqTR4TiacZ7sCfkHhcGgWdDOv2v2HxpHAAuIhwd0hqVQcoOD2_2OWmYVP1phOF2IDMcxP6NqndqjPFpZj89PAUEhoK67O1MzS-6BvjVYBxlr_Hjckacv2TApAj07l2ZswFOeMn5IiMI4IqTKfr1vjoVGxGdypSd1wWfSxIb-Dm5A%3D)\\n,” “You can’t go back and you can’t stand still.
